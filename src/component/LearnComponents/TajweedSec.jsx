                    <h1>Tajweed Ul Qur'an by Shahidi Qaida:</h1>
                    <p>Arabic Wave Academy have launched its own Qur'anic Qaida.We offer special Shahidi Qaida, which we have done some research on every single Tajweed and made by extracting very minute details of Qaida from the expert Qurra in Urdu and English.</p>
                    <h1>What is Tajweed?</h1>
                    <p>The Arabic word Tajweed linguistically means 'proficiency' or 'doing something well'. It comes from the same root letters as the word Jayyid, which means 'good'. When applied to the Qur'an, it means giving every letter of the Qur'an its rights and dues of characteristics when we recite the Qur'an, and observing the rules that apply to those letters in different situations. We give the letters their rights by observing the essential characteristics of each letter. We give them their dues by observing the characteristics of each letter that are present in them some of the time and not present at other times.</p>
                    <p>The Qur'an was revealed with Tajweed rules applied to it. In other words, when the angel Jibreel (Gabriel), may Allah exalt his mention, recited the words of Allah to the Prophet Muhammad  sallallaahu  `alayhi  wa  sallam ( may  Allah exalt his mention ) he recited them in a certain way and he showed the Prophet  sallallaahu  `alayhi  wa  sallam ( may  Allah exalt his mention ) the ways in which it was permissible to recite the Qur'an. So it is obligatory upon us to observe those rules so that we recite it in the way it was revealed.</p>
                    <h1>The Purpose of Tajweed</h1>
                    <p>The Qur'an is the word of Allah, and its every syllable is from Allah. Its recitation must be taken very seriously. The purpose of the Science of Tajweed, in essence, is to make the reciter proficient in reciting the Qur'an, observing the correct pronunciation of every letter with the rulings and characteristics which apply to it, without any exaggeration or deficiency. Through this, the reciter can recite the Qur'an according to the way of the Prophet  Sallallahu  `alayhi  wa  sallam ( may  Allah exalt his mention ) who received it from Jibreel who received it from Almighty Allah in the Classical Arabic language.</p>
                    <p>Each Arabic letter has a Makhraj (an exit or articulation point from which it originates) and Sifaat (attributes or characteristics). Knowing the Makhraj and Sifaat of each letter is an important part of Tajweed. Sometimes two letters have very similar exits, which makes mixing them up easy. So, if a person does not know the attributes of each letter, he may change the meaning of the words in Qur'an recitation. Observing the rules of Tajweed in reciting prevents the reciter from making mistakes in reciting the Qur'an.</p>
                    <h1>The importance of Tajweed</h1>
                    <p>The Noble Qur’an is the literal words of Allah that He revealed as an infallible source of legislation for mankind to live an organised life by. It contains regulations and recommendations about all aspects of life and references to the Hereafter. Being so important, the Qur’an must be read, written, and recited correctly and clearly, so as not to create any sort of ambiguity or misunderstanding whatsoever. Allah Almighty addressed His Messenger, Muhammad sallallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam (may Allah exalt his mention), in the Qur’an, Saying (what means): “…And recite the Qur’an with measured recitation.” [Qur’an 73:4]</p>
                    <p>Listening to the Qur’an being recited correctly is enough to soften even the hardest of hearts. Muslims and non-Muslims alike find it a deeply moving experience, even if they do not understand what is being said. Every Muslim has to recite Qur’an in prayers, but many of us do not realise that reciting the Qur’an correctly while observing the rules of recitation is not an advanced science for expert reciters alone, rather it is an obligation upon each and every one of us whenever we recite the Qur’an.</p>
                    <p>Usman ibn Affan(may Allah be pleased with Him) narrated that the Messenger of Allah PBUH stated: “The best among you are those who learns the Qur’an and teaches it to others.”</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>In addition to this, there are numerous rewards mentioned in the Qur'an and book of Sunan about learning and reciting the Qur’an. One of these rewards is, one good deed is obtained by reciting one letter of Qur’an and reward of every good deed is ten times to that of the original one(Sunan Al-Tirmidhi: 01)</p>
                    <p>Do keep in mind that these virtues and rewards can only be obtained when the Qur’an is recited with proper pronunciation and correct attributions(sahih makharij). The Qur’an must be recited in the same manner of Prophet PBUH and His Companions. If not done so, they can be entitled to sin rather than rewards.</p>
                    <h1>The Ruling of Reading with Tajweed</h1>
                    <p>Imaam Muhammad Ibn Al-Jazari ( may  Allah  have  mercy  upon)  him who was a great Qur'an and Hadeeth scholar of the 9th Hijri century, stated in his famous poem that details the rules of Tajweed:</p>
                    <p>"And applying Tajweed is an issue of absolute necessity, Whoever doesn't apply Tajweed to the Qur'an, then a sinner is he."</p>
                    <p>Hence, applying the rules of Tajweed is an obligation to keep away from the major mistakes in reciting the Qur'an.</p>
                    <p>The scholars have divided the types of mistakes one might fall into when reciting the Qur'an into two:</p>
                    <p>1. Clear mistakes: which usually change obvious things and change the meaning.</p>
                    <p>2. Hidden mistakes: for which one may need to study Tajweed rules.</p>
                    <p>The majority of scholars agree that applying the Tajweed rules of the Qur'an such that the clear mistakes are avoided is an individual obligation (Fardh 'Ayn) upon every Muslim who has memorised part or all of the Qur'an, while applying the rules of Tajweed to avoid the hidden mistakes is a collective obligation (Fardh Kifaayah) upon Muslims. That is, there must be some students of knowledge who have knowledge of that. This is because the Qur'an was revealed with the Tajweed rules applied to it, and the Prophet  sallallahu  `alayhi  wa  sallam ( may  Allah exalt his mention ) recited it back to Jibreel in that way and the companions of the Prophet  sallallahu  `alayhi  wa  sallam ( may  Allah exalt his mention )  read it in that way, so it is an established Sunnah (Prophetic tradition or practice).</p>
