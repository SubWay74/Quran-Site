            <h1>Why Is Adhan (Azaan) So Important For Muslims?</h1>

            <p>The call to prayer in Islam isn't just a way to show that you believe in Islam. It is also how a Muslim community lets the rest of the country know it is there. Adhan has been a part of the Islamic way of life for a long time. It's a call for Muslims to meet at mosques, where people from all walks of life, rich and poor, literate and illiterate, pray together five times a day. Since the time of Prophet Muhammad in the 7th century, when a preacher from a mosque would say the adhan, it meant that there were Muslims nearby. Because adhan is essential to a Muslim's daily life, any limits on it are seen as a violation of their religious rights.</p>
            <h1>How the Adhan Came To Be the Prayer's Call In Islam</h1>
            <p>Muslims and people of other religions each have their way of getting people to come to their places of worship. Christians use church bells to call people to public prayers, while Jews use horns. When it's time to pray, Zoroastrians light a fire. In Medina, a city in Saudi Arabia, the first Muslims talked about how to get people to come to their first mosque, Al-Masjid a Nabawi, which was named after Prophet Muhammad. In the beginning, there were not many Muslims living in Medina. So, unlike other religions at the time, they didn't need a general call to public prayer.</p>
            <div className="img center">

            </div>
            <p>As the number of Muslims in Medina grew and Islam became the main religion, there was a general need to make a public call from a specific place. Adhan is an Arabic word from the phrase adhina, which means "to listen, hear, or learn about."</p>
            <p>Prophet Muhammad usually talked with his followers about critical public issues before deciding. He gathered his companions to talk about how to handle the problem of calling everyone to pray simultaneously. There were many ideas, like building a fire, ringing a bell, or blowing a horn. But nothing was decided at the meeting, which took place in Medina in 622. After the meeting, one of the Prophet's friends, Abdullah bin Zayd, had a dream in which the words of the adhan were shown to him.</p>
            <p>"The next morning, he told the Prophet (PBUH) about his dream. The Prophet felt it was a fantastic idea and said, "So beautiful."</p>
            <p>Zayd's idea was not only "beautiful" but also different from calls to public prayer in other religions. This shows how the Islamic faith is different from other religions.</p>
            <h1>The Beauty of The Adhan Is Meaningful</h1>
            <p>The Prophet liked the idea of using a human voice to call people to prayer, so he told Zayd to teach Bilal ibn Rabah, a formerly enslaved person from Abyssinia (now Ethiopia) who became one of the first Muslims in Mecca, how to recite the adhan.</p>
            <p>'Let Bilal say adhan since his voice is wonderful,' the Prophet said to Zayd, highlighting the significance of a beautiful voice to say the call to prayer, who is also a specialist on religious melody and an adhan reciter called a muezzin.</p>
            <p>Several Muslim stories say that Bilal said the first adhan from the roof of a wealthy woman's house in Medina. It was for prayer in the morning. After that, Bilal recited the adhan in his soothing voice. Prophet Muhammad knew that a soothing recitation was a key part of getting Muslims and non-Muslims to accept Islam's message.</p>
            <p>Over the years, the people in charge of running mosques have paid extra attention to the muezzins who have musical voices. "In the past, we had people like Hafiz Cemal. People opened their windows to hear his beautiful voice when he recited an adhan from the minaret of Istanbul's Aksaray Valide Mosque, where he was a muezzin. Even trams pulled by horses stopped to listen to him read," he says.</p>
            <h1>Calling the Faithful But Nicely!</h1>
            <p>One of the essential Deobandi scholars, Maulana Ashraf Ali Thanwi, gave them a way out. He said it was okay to use the loudspeaker because it didn't change the sound or voice. He thinks the loudspeaker helps the public hear what the Imam and muezzin are saying, so it doesn't bother the congregation. Thanwi's fatwa made it possible for other people to make similar arguments for the public address system.</p>
            <div className="img center">

            </div>
            <p>Even though this is a religious rule, people still argue about the loudspeaker for the Azans. It raised new questions, like what to do when the Azan is recited at the same time from two or more mosques. How should the Azan be read over the loudspeaker in a way acceptable to religion? How do you react when non-Muslims complain about the loud sound of the Azan?</p>
            <h1>The Greatest Calling Is Azan</h1>
            <p>The Azan has been sung all over the world. The Azan is a beautiful Islamic voice. It has been sent out five times a day. The voices of the Azans are the same everywhere in the world. They praise the greatness of Allah Subhanahu Wa Ta'ala, call people to pray, and invite them to win. The Azan also reminds us to meet Allah Ta'ala. You may also want to learn how to pray for success and success. Allah Subhanahu Wa Ta'ala will take Mu'adzin to heaven.</p>
            <p>The Azan reminds us to fight our desires, which makes us work harder at prayer. Not only is it based on the hadith that was explained in the eighth priority, but Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alaihi Wa Sallam also explained it in a hadith:</p>
            <p>Abu Hurairah said, "We heard from Rasulullah SAW that Bilal stood up to sound the Azan, and when he was done, Rasulullah SAW said, "Whoever says this will go to heaven."</p>
            <p>So, the Azan is very important in Islam. We hope this article will be helpful and help us have more faith in Allah Subhanahu Wa Ta'ala. Amen.</p>
            <h1>Adhan's Benefits and Rewards</h1>
            <p>There are two kinds of fruits and effects of adhan. One type is that everyone who lives in the area where the adhan is given benefits from it. The second one talks about what the mu'adhdhin does for people. In general, there are a lot of good things and impacts</p>
            <p>⦁	Shaytan runs away from where the adhan is recited, leaving the area where the mu'adhdhin's voice can be heard. Sayyiduna Abu Hurairah (radhiyallahu anhu) wrote in Sahih Bukhari that Rasulullah (Sallallahu Alayhi wasallam) said, "When the call of adhan is given, shaytan flees while passing wind, so much so that he can't hear the adhan. He returns when the adhan is finished.</p>
            <p>⦁	On that day, the general punishment and wrath of Allah Azza wa Jal will not fall on the city, town, or village where the adhan is given. When the name of Allah is said in a place, and His mercy comes down, it is clear that His punishment can't beat them on that day. How can you have both mercy and anger?</p>
            <p>⦁	Whether alive or not, whether it is a human or something else, whether a Muslim or not, feels the adhan and enjoys it wherever it is called out. Because of this, everything that hears the mu'adhdhin's voice prays for him, and on the Day of Qiyamah, it will testify to his faith and Islam. This is what everyone will get out of adhan, and the mu'adhdhin will also get something out of it. Many good things happen to the mu'adhdhin.</p>
