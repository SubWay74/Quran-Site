            <p>Having the Quran memorized and becoming a Hafiz In Islam, being able to read the Quran is a great honour that brings many good things in this life and the next. It could be a significant spiritual, mental, and physical challenge to learn how to memorise the Quran and say the whole thing correctly. If that were true, a 7-year-old wouldn't be able to learn the whole Quran. There are many tricks, tips, and hacks for learning the Quran that can help you or your kids learn it quickly and easily. To support their Muslim brothers and sisters learn the Quran, Hifz teachers at Arabic Wave have chosen the Top Tips to Learn the Quran Quickly and Easily.</p>
            <h1>Memorizing the Quran with Pure Intention</h1>
            <p>When you want to learn the Quran, you must ensure that learning is not your primary goal. Your goal should be to please Allah (SWT), to make Him happy, and to get to Paradise. One of the most important things you can do to learn the Quran is to want to know it. It's the foundation for everything else. If your goal were to learn the Quran by heart, the learning process would be much easier and more rewarding. On the other hand, if you want to show off or get people's attention, your journey will be challenging and give you nothing in return.</p>
            <h1>Set Up a Good Plan and Goals to Learn the Quran</h1>
            <p>The key to success has always been to plan well and set clear goals. So bring a piece of paper and a pen and write down how you plan to learn the Quran. Check-in on your plan and timeline at each meeting to make sure you are on track. Setting goals that can be reached is one of the essential tips for learning the Quran. Don't try too hard to learn big chunks of the Quran simultaneously. You might be tempted to learn one or two pages of the Quran each time you study. But you may soon give up because you don't have enough time. Instead, remember less of the Quran at a time, like 5 to 8 lines daily.</p>
            <h1>Recite in Prayers, What You've Learned </h1>
            <div className="img center">

            </div>
            <p>One of the best ways to learn verses from the Quran is to say them out loud during prayers (Salats). So, you'll be able to practise what you've learned at least five times daily. Salah is a particular act of worship that brings us closer to Allah (SWT). When you try to recite new Quranic verses you've learned while doing it, you might not only be able to remember them but also learn more about what they mean.</p>
            <h1>Use Flash Cards</h1>
            <p>A flashcard also called a flash card is a piece of paper with words or numbers on one or both sides. It is often used as a learning drill to help people remember things. Some Bible verses can be easy to remember if you write them down on flashcards and keep them around when you have free time. One good way to learn the Quran on your own is to use flashcards. It not only helps you remember it, but you also get to know each line much better every time you pull it out to review.</p>
            <h1>Get Assistance from a Quran Teacher Who Is a Professional</h1>
            <p>Even though you can learn to memorize the Quran on your own, a professional Quran teacher can make it much easier, faster, and better. Memorizing the Quran is a hard thing to do, especially if you try to do it by yourself. The Quran tutor will help you or your children with every step of learning the Quran. They will not only help you learn the Quran but also help you understand what the verses mean, say them correctly, and learn Arabic so you can master it.</p>
            <h1>Learn Arabic So You Can Memorize the Quran</h1>
            <div className="img center">

            </div>
            <p>If Arabic is not your first language, you must first learn how to read the Quran in Arabic. To learn the Hifz Quran, you must know how to say it correctly. Even though the holy Quran was translated into many languages, including English, these translations couldn't show what the verses meant. This is because the original language of the Quran, Arabic, has a set of features that make it different from other languages. Memorising the Quran in Arabic makes it easier to learn, say, and remember the Quran by heart. It tries to help the person trying to learn the Quran remember how the words look and sound.</p>
            <h1>Learn How to Remember the Quran with Tajweed</h1>
            <p>Muslims should be able to recite the Quran correctly, just as the prophet Muhammad said, to learn how to memorise it (PBUH). This will try to make someone's memory firm. When you learn to recite the Quran with Tajweed, your tongue will always return to a specific tone of voice. This means that if the balance or harmony of your recitation gets off, you will know you made a mistake. Also, learning to memorise the Quran with Tajweed gives it a beautiful, melodic tone that makes it easier to keep going with the process.</p>
            <h1>Use the Exact Mushaf Copy</h1>
            <p>One way to make it easier to learn the Quran is always to use the same Mushaf (Holy Quran Hard-Copy). This will help you focus on the familiarity factor. A Muslim learns the Quran by both hearings and seeing it. When the verses are read and looked at often, the way they are written and where they are in the Mushaf stick in mind.</p>
            <h1>Understand the Verses You're Memorizing</h1>
            <p>One of the best ways to learn the Qur'an is to understand what the verses mean and how they connect. The person trying to learn the Quran should read the Tafsir (explanation) of the verses they want to learn. It will be easier for them to remember the Quran if they think about what it means as they read it. Knowing what the verses mean is very important if you want to learn the Quran by heart and get more out of reciting it.</p>
            <h1>Recite to Others What You've Memorized</h1>

            </div>
            <p>One of the best ways to learn the Quran is to tell other people what you have learned. It would be best to read the verses out loud to your family, a friend, or your teacher to see how well you remember them. Even when looking at the Mushaf, it is very common to make mistakes when learning a Surah by heart. But if you read the Qur'an to other people, they will always point out errors so you can fix them.</p>
