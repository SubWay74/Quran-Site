Some folks require more working time before they can understand anything. Some people learn things quickly and wish they could hurry through their lessons to get good grades.

When you take an online course, you can go at your own pace, which means you can finish assignments as quickly or slowly as you need. Choosing your own pace can also take away much of the stress that comes with school. And having less anxiety can help you focus better, which can help you get better grades and have better outcomes.

Planned and unplanned events can change your regular schedule, especially if you have kids who have changing schedules, special events, and other activities.</p>
