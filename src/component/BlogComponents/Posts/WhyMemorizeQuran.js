            <p>It's easy to learn and remember the Quran online when you hire a qualified Quran tutor to teach. Every Muslim wants to learn the Holy Quran by heart, but most of our brothers and sisters can't because they are too busy or don't have enough help. Arabic Wave knows how important it is to learn the Quran by heart, so they have online classes to help people learn the Quran at home. "Quran Memorization Online" was made by Arabic Wave for our brothers and sisters who want to learn the Quran a lot and are interested in it. What makes our Online Hifz course special isn't a hard and fast rule. Instead, it's the common but tactful strategies we use in a very thoughtful and organized way to help you get the most out of our online Hifz classes. What differentiates us from the thousands of websites that help you learn the Quran? Let's dive in</p>
            <h1>Our Online Hifz Program Offers Well-Structured Hifz Strategies!</h1>
            <p>Even though our teaching schedule is different for each student based on their abilities and mental level, it takes between 10 and 37 months to learn the whole Quran online. Still, the Hifz student has the last word on how much he does each day, and the plan is based on that. For example, our plans to help you learn Surah Al-Baqarah of the Quran are based on how long it will take you to learn it (2 to 5 months). Teachers send students a link to the calendars through email. And it works great because Hifz students stay organized and are ready for each Online Hifz Class.</p>
            <p>You might notice one thing! There is no one rule that all students have to follow. Certainly, it's a stupid thing. After figuring out each student's Quran Hifz level and ability, we make a personalized Hifz plan for them. We consider the students' schedules, so they don't have too much Hifz homework to do at home since too much of something can make students tired of it halfway through.</p>
            <h1>Expert Online Quran Memorization Instructors</h1>
            <p>The Online Hifz Course is made fun and easy to follow. Before formal classes begin, the online Hifz Tutor checks to see how well each student can remember things. Here are a few things that our Quran tutors have:</p>
            <p>⦁	They are all Hafiz, which means they all learned the Quran when they were very young</p>
            <p>⦁	So many non-Arab students learned a lot of the Quran online with their help</p>
            <p>⦁	After a long process of tests, the Hifz teachers have proven that they are qualified to teach our Memorization Course students</p>
            <p>Not just a simple way to hire people! But they were chosen from a large pool of candidates because they have the skills to teach you. Not only are they trained to meet the needs of the modern world, but they are also very good at what they do. Here, it's a given that you'll be able to memorise the Quran with the help of our well-organized online Hifz course and a very knowledgeable and determined Hifz environment.</p>
