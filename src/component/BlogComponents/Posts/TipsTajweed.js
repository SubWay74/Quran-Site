            <p>For people whose first language is not Arabic, it can be hard to learn Tajweed Beginners. But Tajweed is very important if you want to learn how to say the Quran correctly. It helps us say each word and letter of the Quran correctly by showing us where to start and end each sound. To understand the Quran, you should also learn Tajweed Quran. It teaches us how to say the Arabic alphabet correctly so that our words mean what we want them to. Any small mistake in saying the words of Allah (SWT) could make the verses of the Quran mean something completely different, which is a serious Sin. Because every Muslim needs to know how to read the Quran with Tajweed, Quran Experts at Arabic Wave have put together The Top Tips to Learn Tajweed for Beginners.</p>
            <h1>Find a Qualified Tajweed Quran Teacher</h1>
            <p>For a beginner to learn Tajweed, they need help, guidance, and supervision from a professional Quran tutor. It would be best if you looked for a qualified teacher who can teach you the rules of tajweed, how to say words, where letters are pronounced, how to tell the difference between sounds, etc. They will show you everything, from the beginning to the most advanced level. Also, the Quran teacher will listen to you read the Quran, figure out how good you are, and keep correcting you until you master Quran Tajweed.</p>
            <p>If you live in a country that doesn't speak Arabic, it would be hard to find a Quran teacher or school near you. In this case, the best thing to do would be to learn Quran at home with the help of an online Quran tutor. You can find many Quran teachers who are very good for you or your kids. They teach Tajweed online as freelancers or employees of a website that helps people learn the Quran.</p>
            <h1>Step-By-Step Rules for Tajweed</h1>
            <p>Don't be in a hurry to learn the rules of Tajweed. Give yourself enough time to learn and master each lesson before moving on to the next. This is one of the most important things you can do to learn anything new, not just Tajweed. This can make you feel confused and overloaded. One of the best things about Quran eLearning is that the courses are flexible, can be changed, and have a clear structure. First, the online Quran tutor checks how well you can read the Quran. Then, based on the evaluation, they decide on the course schedule, the course syllabus, and the way students will learn.</p>

            <p>The first step in learning Tajweed is to get pretty good at the Arabic alphabet and how to say it in all its forms. We use the Shahidi Qaida book for this step, which has the same order of lessons and exercises. Once you know how to say the Arabic letters, thanks to Shahidi Qaida's book, it's easier to say the words in the Quran. It also helps you understand many parts of Tajweed, like where the sounds are made and what the letters look like.</p>
            <h1>Listen to Someone Read the Quran with Tajweed</h1>
            <p>One of the best ways for people whose first language is not Arabic to learn Tajweed is to listen as much as possible to the Quran being read with Tajweed. Listen to the beautiful recitation repeatedly on TV, on your laptop, or on your phone so you can get used to how to say it. Also, listening to the Quran is a sunnah, and Allah (SWT) may bless you.</p>
            <h1>Practice Learning Tajweed Over And Over Again</h1>
            <p>The fastest way to get good at something is to practise it repeatedly. So, if you are starting and want to learn Tajweed Quran or become a Hafiz Quran, you need to keep practising. Even if you are taking online Quran classes with a Quran teacher, practice is what makes everything you have learned come to life. So try to make practising Tajweed Quran a part of your everyday life. Day by day, you'll notice how much better you are at reciting the Quran.</p>
            <h1>You Can Learn both the Theory and the Practice of Tajweed</h1>
            <p>If you want to learn Tajweed to the level of ITQAN, you need to learn both the theory and the practice of it. Tajweed should not just be thought of as a matter of accents or dialects. It covers many essential things about the holy Quran, like the timing of syllables, the clarity of expressions, and how each letter changes how a word is said.</p>
            <p>Theoretical Education of Tajweed is about clarifying Tajweed's rules without using them to recite the Quran with Tajweed or practising them.</p>
            <p>Practical Tajweed Knowledge is about the pronunciation rules of Tajweed and how to use them to read and recite the Quran in Arabic correctly.</p>

            <h1>Get Ijazah in Quran Tajweed</h1>
            <p>This is an advanced tip for learning how to master Tajweed Quran. An ijazah is a licence that lets the person who has it send a specific text or subject. It is given by someone who already has the right to do so. The person who has an Ijazah in Tajweed has learned and mastered how to read the Quran with Tajweed. Now they can teach or recite the Quran with Tajweed by chains of reciters that end with the prophet Muhammad (PBUH). At Quran Oasis, you can get Ijazah online in Tajweed Quran if you can recite the whole Quran using Tajweed rules in front of one of our Ijaza certified tutors.</p>
            <h1>Teach Others How to Read Tajweed Quran</h1>
            <p>After you get Ijazah in Tajweed Quran, you can teach anyone how to read the Quran with Tajweed. People think this is a great way to not only do good things but also learn Tajweed and never forget it. As 'Uthman told it, the Prophet (PBUH) said:</p>
            <p>‘’The best Muslims are the ones who study the Qur'an and teach it to others’’ Hadith [Sahih al-Bukhari 5027]</p>
            <p>Even if you are still learning, teaching Quran Tajweed to others will help you learn much better and faster. This is called the "Protégé Effect." It is a psychological phenomenon in which teaching something to someone else enables you to learn it yourself. This tip will help you learn faster and better by making you more likely to use effective learning strategies, more interested in learning the Quran, and more confident and independent.</p>
