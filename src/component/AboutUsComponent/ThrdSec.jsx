We at Arabic Wave work hard so that every Muslim can understand and read the Holy Quran by following the rules of Tajweed. We wish that the students will use what they have learned in their everyday lives to be good examples for this global society. We strive to teach people so that every Muslim not just reads the Quran but also should know the true meaning of the Quran.</p>
