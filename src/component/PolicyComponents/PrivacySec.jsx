            <p>The Privacy Policy tells Arabic Wave how to collect, use, keep, and share information about people who use its website (each a "User"). This privacy statement applies to the Site and all of Arabic Wave's goods and services.</p>
            <h1>What Types of Information Do We Collect?</h1>
            <p>Arabic Wave gets a lot of different kinds of Personal Information from our users, as shown below. Students' information will only be used for school or educational purposes. We may use the information you give us to improve our services, let our users make profiles, give you the services you ask for, study how users interact with the Website, and do other things listed in this Privacy Policy. We don't share certain kinds of Personal Information with anyone other than the Support and Quality teams.</p>
            <h1>Data You Give Us</h1>
            <p>We receive and store any information you give us voluntarily. We collect Personal Information about you, like your name, user name, and email address, when you sign up for an evaluation or on our system, for example. We may collect more Personal Information from you when you use our services, like notes you make about your connections. However, other Website users will not see these private notes unless you choose to share them. You can choose not to give us some information, but if you do, you might not be able to use many of our unique services.</p>
            <h1>Disclosure</h1>
            <p>If the law says we have to or if you break our Terms of Service, we may tell other people about you.</p>
            <h1>Payment</h1>
            <p>We'll take payments through PayPal. Your credit card information is not kept on their systems. The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard encrypts data when payments are being processed (PCI-DSS). Your information about a purchase transaction is only used to finish that purchase transaction. After your purchase transaction is done, no record of it is kept.</p>
            <p>The PCI Security Standards Council, which comprises companies like American Express, Discover, MasterCard, and Visa, sets the rules for PCI-DSS, which our payment gateway meets.</p>
            <h1>Security</h1>
            <p>We take reasonable steps and use best practices in the industry to ensure that your personal information isn't lost, misused, accessed, shared, changed, or deleted in a way that isn't right.</p>
            <h1>Cookies</h1>
            <p>Cookies are used to keep the session of your user going. It is not used on other websites to find out who you are.</p>
            <h1>The Period Of Consent</h1>
            <p>By using this site, you confirm that you are at least the legal age of majority in your state or province or that you are at least the legal age of majority in your state or province and have permitted us to let any of your minor dependents use this site.</p>
            <h1>Modifications to This Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p>We can change this privacy statement at any time, so please check it from time to time. Once they are posted on the website, changes and clarifications will take effect. If we change this policy in a big way, we will let you know here so you know what information we collect, how we use it, and when, if ever, we use and share it.</p>
            <p>If our business is sold or merged with another company, your information may be given to the new owners so that we can continue to offer you things.</p>
            <h1>Concerns Or Questions</h1>
            <p>Please let us know if our privacy policies aren't clear or if you have any questions. If you need more information, you can email us. Inshaâ€™Allah, we will do everything we can to help you.</p>
